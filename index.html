    <h1>Brainstorming Ideas for Different Types of Websites</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A website to find all types of school textbooks-such as the AIS textbooks</li>
        <li>A website that has all the cafeteria foods in AIS- to see what type of culinary there are in AIS</li>
        <li>A website that shows all the teams and their greatest achievements in AIS-Maybe, because there is the school website for it</li>
        <li>A website for different backgrounds for your desktop, powerpoint presentations, any device's- audience directed to mostly students and people that are trying to make their powerpoints/background look more intriguing</li>
    <h2>What are the main audiences you are trying to target?</h2>
        <p>I am mainly trying to aim at students all around the world</p>
    </div>
    <div class= "Ideas">
    <h1>Choosing My Idea</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Final Decision: A website for most common types of school's textbooks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I chose this idea mainly because I feel that a lot of studnets (lincluding myself) are always looking for their school texbooks
          in different websites, and I feel that is incredibly difficult to find the type of textbook in just one website. Sometimes the website
          has different types of school textbooks but they either do not have the answers to the questions or they are missing different pages.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    <div class="Math">
    <h1>Group Project</h1>
    <h3>Final Decision: Website for all AIS math textbooks</h3>
    <h3>Client: Math teachers</h3>
    <p> How are we going to approach it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> We are going to make a pdf-viewer type of textbooks for all the answers and the working out</li>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Get the PDFs from the math teachers</li>
    <li>What are we trying to solve?</li>
          We are trying to solve the trouble for students when they do not know an answer while doing their math answer. Also, it is more easier for the teachers
          since the website does not require them to answer the students emails, asking for help.</li>
    <li>Website will have easy navigation- there will be a search bar on the side and a list of the textbooks on the side bar as well<li>
    <li>Viewable PDFs at the top will have a search bar for pages and differet chapters</li>
    <li>Different tabs will open when clicked to different textbooks to make it easier and convient for the audience</li>
    <li>Website will be simple to make it easier to navigate and easier access- </li>
    <li>FOR students that are struggling with chapter 14 in Algebra 3, they can use this website TO help them study the chapter by quizzes and tips.</li>
    <li>FOR Mr. Kang TO not have to make a mdoodle page just for chapter 14 for the sake of students that are struggling with chapter 14. </li>
    <li>FOR people outside in the real world TO study for trignometry, can access this website and practice before their test.<li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Our goals:</h4>
    <ol type;"a">
      <li>Making it potentially easier for the students to access to answer and working out without asking their teachers for help</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div class= "Yearbook">
    <h1>New Idea (the old one did not turn out good):</h1>
    <h3>YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPHY PAGE</h3>
    <h4>Objectives:</h4>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
      <li>Client: Mr. Leung</li>
      <li>What is upmost important: that the students can view all the assignments and get it done :)</li>
      <li>He wants the website to be extremely simple and easy to access.</li>
      <li>What the problem is: People are having a hard time finding the google doc for the assignments on Facebook</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>FOR Mr. Leung to make it more easier to communicate TO the yearbook photography club, we are going to make a website that enables all
        the students that are in the club to see what is currently happening to the club, when the due dates are, and what good and bad photography is.</li>
      <li> FOR the students in the yearbook photography club TO make is easier to access and TO make it easier to find the information, we are going to use
        this website instead of Facebook.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Progress: </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>6th Jan- so far we have done the flowchart and now we are finally planning our wire frame board</li>
    <ol>
      <li>So far we have finally solved the problem- how we were going to update the upcoming assignments- by using google docs</li>
      <li>7th Jan- we started our wireframe board (learnt a couple of stuff such as how to create guides, lines, rulers, etc)</li>
      <li>12th Jan- starting to finish our homepage wireframe + made the to do list</li>

    <h2>Feedback on story board:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The background- a little bit distracting</li>
      <li>Straight to the point- extremely simple :)</li>
      <li>Change the font= not appealing to the eye</li>
    </ol>

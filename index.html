    <h1>Brainstorming Ideas</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A website to find all types of school textbooks-such as the AIS textbooks</li>
        <li>A website that has all the cafeteria foods in AIS- to see what type of culinary there are in AIS</li>
        <li>A website that shows all the teams and their greatest achievements in AIS-Maybe, because there is the school website for it</li>
        <li>A website for different backgrounds for your desktop, powerpoint presentations, any device's- audience directed to mostly students and people that are trying to make their powerpoints/background look more intriguing</li>
    <h2>What are the main audiences you are trying to target?</h>
        <p>I am mainly trying to aim at students all around the world</p>

    <h1>Choosing My Idea</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Final Decision: A website for most common types of school's textbooks</li>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
        <li>I chose this idea mainly because I feel that a lot of studnets (lincluding myself) are always looking for their school texbooks
          in different websites, and I feel that is incredibly difficult to find the type of textbook in just one website. Sometimes the website
          has different types of school textbooks but they either do not have the answers to the questions or they are missing different pages.

    <h1>Brainstorming Ideas</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A website to find all types of school textbooks-such as the AIS textbooks</li>
        <li>A website that has all the cafeteria foods in AIS- to see what type of culinary there are in AIS</li>
        <li>A website that shows all the teams and their greatest achievements in AIS-Maybe, because there is the school website for it</li>
        <li>A website for different backgrounds for your desktop, powerpoint presentations, any device's- audience directed to mostly students and people that are trying to make their powerpoints/background look more intriguing</li>
